        BLOGS dummy text ====\/ Why React-Bootstrap? React-Bootstrap is a
        complete re-implementation of the Bootstrap components using React. It
        has no dependency on either bootstrap.js or jQuery. If you have React
        setup and React-Bootstrap installed, you have everything you need.

        events using jQuery is done imperatively by directly manipulating the
        DOM. In contrast, React uses updates to the state to update the virtual
        DOM. In this way, React-Bootstrap provides a more reliable solution by
        incorporating Bootstrap functionality into React's virtual DOM. Below
        are a few examples of how React-Bootstrap components differ from
        Bootstrap. A Simple React Component # The CSS and details of Bootstrap
        components are rather opinionated and lengthy. React-Bootstrap
        simplifies this by condensing the original Bootstrap into React-styled
